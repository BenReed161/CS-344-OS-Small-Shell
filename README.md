# CS-344-OS-Small-Shell
A smaller and much more slimmed down version of the linux shell, created in C. Assigned as part of the Operating Systems class I took at Oregon State University. 
The Small Shell program demonstrates the child and parent relationship of linux. It attempts to replicate the bash shell and supports regular linux commands and has certain functionality pertaining to the assignment rubric. One feature that highlights the program is its ability to run certain commands in the "background" whilst the main shell continues to accept commands.
